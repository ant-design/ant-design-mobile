## ImageViewer

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| afterClose | Triggered when it is completely closed | `() => void` | - |
| classNames | Semantic structure class | `{ mask?:string,body?:string }` | - | 5.33.1 |
| getContainer | To get the specified mounted HTML node, the default is `null` rendered to the current node | `HTMLElement \| () => HTMLElement \| null` | `null` |
| image | The `url` of the image resource | `string` | - |
| maxZoom | The maximum zoom ratio | `number \| 'auto'` | `3` |
| onClose | Triggered when it is closed | `() => void` | - |
| renderFooter | Render extra content on footer | `(image: string) => ReactNode` | - |
| visible | Whether to show or hide | `boolean` | `false` |

## ImageViewer.Multi

On the basis of `ImageViewer`, the following props have been added:

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| classNames | Semantic structure class | `{ mask?:string,body?:string }` | - | 5.33.1 |
| defaultIndex | Which picture would be displayed by default | `number` | `0` |
| images | Url list of image resources | `string[]` | - |
| onIndexChange | Triggered when the picture is switched | `(index: number) => void` | - |
| renderFooter | Render extra content on footer | `(image: string, index: number) => ReactNode` | - |

At the same time, the `image` prop is removed.

### Ref

| Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| swipeTo | Switch to the specified index | `(index: number, immediate: boolean) => void` |

## Imperative

Compared with the component-based usage above, the command-style is more convenient and more commonly used. In most cases, this method is recommended:

```ts | pure
const handler = ImageViewer.show(props)
const handlerMulti = ImageViewer.Multi.show(props)
```

You can directly enter the image view by calling the `show` method on the `ImageViewer`. The type of the `props` parameter is the same as the above table, but the `visible` prop is not supported. When the viewer is closed, the component instance would be automatically destroyed.

The return value of the `show` method is a component controller, which contains the following props:

| Name  | Description                       | Type         |
| ----- | --------------------------------- | ------------ |
| close | Function to close the ImageViewer | `() => void` |

If you want to close all ImageViewers created by the `show` method. You can call `ImageViewer.clear()`.

## FAQ

### Why I updated the value of `defaultIndex`, but the image displayed by ImageViewer.Multi did not switch?

ImageViewer.Multi is an [uncontrolled](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#controlled-vs-uncontrolled-components) component, `defaultIndex` is only read once when the component is loaded, After this, if you change the value of `defaultIndex`, it will not have any effect on the component. Therefore, the following writing method does not have the effect of switching pictures:

```jsx
<Button
  onClick={() => {
    setIndex(i => i + 1)
  }}
>
  Next
</Button>
<ImageViewer.Multi
  images={images}
  defaultIndex={index}
  visible={visible}
  onClose={() => {
    setVisible(false);
  }}
/>
```

You can use ref for manual manipulation of ImageViewer.Multi, or consider using `ImageViewer.show()`.
