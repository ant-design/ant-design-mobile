# NumberKeyboard <Experimental></Experimental>

Numeric keypad panel.

## When to Use

Applicable when entering numeric content.

Can be used with password input box component or custom input box component

If possible, we recommend using the native keyboard provided by the system or client. The virtual numeric keypad is just a supplement for some special scenarios.

## Demos

tips: It is recommended to open the demo on the mobile side for better preview effect, because the touch event used by the component cannot be seen on the web side.
